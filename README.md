# Super-Resolution Imaging
 
Super-resolution imaging techniques are used in general image processing and in super-resolution microscopy.

In some radar and sonar imaging applications (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), high-resolution computed tomography), subspace decomposition-based methods and compressed sensing-based algorithms are employed to achieve SR over standard periodogram algorithm.
